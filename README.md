# ðŸ“‚ File Watcher & Backup Script

This Python script monitors a specified folder (`watched_folder`) for **file system events** such as:

- **Creation:** New files are detected in real time  
- **Modification:** Changes to existing files are tracked  
- **Deletion:** Removed files are recorded  
- **Movement:** File renames and moves are captured  

It uses the [`watchdog`](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) library to detect changes in real time.

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

When a **new file** is created in the watched folder:

1. **Copy to backup:** The file is automatically copied to `../backup`.  
2. **Log event:** The action is recorded in `Log.txt`, located one directory above the watched folder.

[ Watched Folder ] --(new file)--> [ Backup Folder ] 
      |                   â†‘                 |
      â””----> Event Logged in Log.txt -------â”˜
```

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-time monitoring:** Detect changes as they happen  
- **Automatic backup:** Newly created files are copied instantly  
- **Event logging:** Timestamps for all detected changes

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- **Python:** 3.x  
- **watchdog:** Install with:

  ```bash
  pip install watchdog
  ```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prepare folders

```bash
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ watched_folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup/        (will be created automatically if missing)
â”œâ”€â”€ Log.txt        (will be created automatically)
â””â”€â”€ file_watcher.py
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install watchdog
```

### Run the script

```bash
python file_watcher.py
```

Test it: Drop a file: Place any file in watched_folder â€” it will be backed up and logged.
